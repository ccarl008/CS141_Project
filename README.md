---

This program calculates the edit distance between two strings and prints the sequence of operations to transform the first string into the second one. The edit distance is defined as the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one string into another.

## Instructions

To compile and run the code in Visual Studio Code, please follow these instructions:

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system (e.g., g++ for Linux or MinGW for Windows).

2. Open the code file (`edit_distance.cpp`) in Visual Studio Code.

3. Install the "C/C++" extension by Microsoft from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace if you haven't already done so.

4. Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code by going to View > Terminal or using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+`).

5. Once the terminal is open, navigate to the directory containing the code file using the `cd` command.

6. To compile and build the code, use the following command in the terminal:
    g++ -std=c++11 editDistance.cpp -o edit_distance

7. After successful compilation, an executable file named `edit_distance` (or a name you specified) will be generated in the same directory.

8. To run the program, use the following command in the terminal:
    ./editDistance

9. The program will output the sequence of operations and the minimum edit distance between two example strings ("clarks" and "kirk"). You can modify the strings inside the `main` function of the code to calculate the edit distance for different inputs.

That's it! You have successfully compiled and run the Edit Distance Calculation program in Visual Studio Code. Feel free to explore the code and modify it to suit your needs.

If you encounter any issues or have further questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Enjoy using the program!
